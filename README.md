Hack Yak
========

My work on reverse engineering and implementing Yik Yak's protocol, forked from the work of Github user SuperSpyTX.

This is for everybody to utilize. I am not responsible for the use of this API! Enjoy.

What is this?
=============

[Yik Yak](http://yikyakapp.com), a geographic based chatting application that allows users to anonymously (not really, all geolocation coordinates are available) post anything for their area. The goal (to my perspective) was to only have college students post bulletins for their college. But, it's actually a terrible service because it's being used for the wrong purpose: high school students cyberbullying.  Ironically, I am a high school student myself and I've already reverse engineered the API.


What could I do with this API?
==============================

Good question.

You can do anything the Yik Yak app can do.  You can post messages, upvote messages as well as downvote them.  I must note that there's really no true verification that happens here, it's all PHP scripts all hidden behind SSL.
