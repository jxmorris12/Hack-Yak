Hack Yak
========

My work on reverse engineering and implementing Yik Yak's protocol, forked from the work of Github user SuperSpyTX.

This is for everybody to utilize. I am not responsible for the use of this API! Enjoy.


What could I do with this API?
==============================

Good question.

You can do anything the Yik Yak app can do.  You can post messages, upvote messages as well as downvote them.  I must note that there's really no true verification that happens here, it's all PHP scripts all hidden behind SSL.
